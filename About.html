      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Sweet Hour Bakery was born out of a lifelong passion for baking and a dream to share joy through sweet, homemade treats. 
        Founded by Ruhma Nazim, what began as a small home kitchen venture has grown into a cherished local bakery known for its warmth, 
        creativity, and irresistible flavors. From the very beginning, Ruhma believed that every dessert should feel like a moment of comfort 
        and celebration. Whether it’s a custom order for a special occasion or a box of cookies just because — every treat is crafted with care, 
        love, and a sprinkle of sweetness. Sweet Hour is more than a bakery; it's a story of passion, family, and community.
